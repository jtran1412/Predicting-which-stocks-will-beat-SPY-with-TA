# Predicting-which-stocks-will-beat-SPY-with-TA
In this project, I create 3 models: 1 linear regression model, 1 time series model and 1 ensemble model. They will all predict which stocks of the S&amp;P100 will beat SPY by at least 10% in 1 year. The models will be trained with stock price, simple moving averages and candle sticks represented mathematically.
